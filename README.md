# Decoder_with_GUI
A program which tries to analyse an input string in many ways. For example with a graph showing the frequency of letters in the text. This should be only made with Python and its extensive libraries such as tkinter,matplotlib,numpy,etc...

The Projects Goals are:
* A working Decryption tool for many known weak Encryptions
* A working GUI showing relevant facts about the input string (e.g. the Frequence of letters in a text, highligthing possible words of said encrypted input text)
* Additional Features for comfortability like saving your sessions and graphs, feeding the analyse-tool not via the GUI but a .txt-file outside the GUI
* And many ideas to come...

This project is just to mess around and visit it once in a while.
